                Hey, I'm Abhik, junior at BIT Mesra from the Electronics and Communications Branch. This is supposed to be a private page, so if you're reading this then hopefully you know me.
                Microsoft was the first company that came to our campus to recruit in a gender neutral manner. Earlier SalesForce had come to only hire women Interns.
                In the morning of 24th July, we were informed that the Coding round was scheduled for 27th of July, while the Interviews mostly took place on 2nd August, and few on 3rd.
                Let's take a deeper look at the individual rounds.
