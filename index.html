                <span class="orange">Hey, I'm Abhik, junior at BIT Mesra from the Electronics and Communications Branch. Probably</span> <span class="green">my first proper blog that I am putting in front of you. Some answers have been avoided </span><span class="orange">which I felt to be personal, though I have tried my best to replicate that day. This is supposed to</span> <span class="green">be a private page, so if you're reading this then hopefully you know me.
                Microsoft was the</span> <span class="blue">first company that came to our campus to recruit in a gender neutral manner. Earlier SalesForce</span><span class="yellow"> had come to only hire women Interns.
                In the morning of 24th July, we were informed that</span> <span class="blue">the Coding round was scheduled for 27th of July, while the Interviews mostly took place on 2nd</span> <span class="yellow">August, and few on 3rd.
                Let's take a deeper look at the individual rounds.</span>

                <h3>Coding Round || 2 Questions  || 80 Minutes</h3>
                <p>
                    Question 1 : Given an array A, and an average S, find the number of subarrays such that the average of it's elements is equal to S. <br>
                    Solution : You can use a hashmap, and a prefix array sum to solve the question in O(n) time. <br>
                    Question 2 : Minesweeper game, with detecting how many bombs are present nearby from a particular point. <br>
                    Solution : You can just traverse through the DDA twice, and count. A pretty easy one.

                <h3>Technical Interview - 1 || 9:00 || 50 Minutes</h3>
                <p>
                    The Interviewer asked me to walk him through my resume. I told him about my projects, positions of responsobilities, and my achievements
                    in various inter college cultural and technical festivals, which mostly covered speaking events, music and development.

                    He was interested about my passions and rolemodels. We had a small chat about the recent India vs Sri Lanka T20 series in July.
                    His technical questions then began, which were mostly regarding my projects in general, and my Full Stack Project in particular. He asked me about normalization and my usage of them.
                    Some questions that he asked were really difficult and couldn't satisfy him properly, but he was somehow considerate. These questions were based on real-life hosting of a popular websites
                    with millions of traffic each day. Database Management was one such field in which he was trying to grill me. Fortunately, I knew most of the answers.

                <h3>Technical Interview - 2 || 10:10 || 70 Minutes</h3>
                <p>
                    My Interviewer, who was also from ECE, had a very energitic tone which oscillated some to me as well. He too made my comfortable by talking about my previous interview, and 
                    talking about interviews in general. Then the questions began. SQL Queries. More SQL Queries. Why was I using those queries. Why not something else.
                    He kept telling that even if I give the right answer, he may still challenge me with its correctness. 
                    He then told me to design an elevator for a newly formed Apartment. Fortunately I had some idea of heaps, and was able to give some considerable logic to him, as quickly as possible.
                    Some random questions of Operating Systems, and then he asked me to describe him an incident in my college life, that really set me back, and how did I cope up with it.
                    I just had the right story to share with him, and he admired it.

                    The interview continued as he visited my Full Stack website and told me straightaway that it's a very usual website with nothing strikingly unique. He asked to explain the architechture that is used.
                    Some questions later, I found myself explaining how I can add new and unique features, so as to get investment for my website. He was pretty critical of my ideas, until I finally (a good 5-6 minutes later) came
                    up with a very unique idea, and finally he moved away to the next topic, satisfied. We talked about authorizations, and their types and implementations. The pros and cons. Overall the interview
                    went pretty well and very detail oriented.

                <h3>HR Interview || 16:45 || 35 Minutes</h3>
                <p>
                    This time my Interviewer did not spend any time in personal talks, and straightaway asked me to design my favourite app.
                    I got a bit worried as I thought it to be a system design question, but as soon as I started explaining him my special Music Player design, he changed the 
                    question to how would I get the royalty money for the songs. An answer to that, and question changing to how would I sell my website, who would be my consumer, what will be different in my website.
                    I tried to answer him as well as I could, citing real life examples, trying to impress him at the same time, occasional and desperate.
                    He was grilling me constantly with wierd situations and how would I cope up with them, to which I tried to answer with utmost honesty.

                    We later on also discussed about the different offices of Microsoft in India in general, and Hyderabad Office in particular.
                    Overall, it was a very interesting discussion.

                The entire day I was pumped with excitement, narrating every little nuances to my friends.
                The next day at 1 p.m, the official platform of the Training and Placement Cell posted the list of the selected candidates, and .. and.. yes. yes. yes.
